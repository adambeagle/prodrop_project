GENERAL GOAL
============
Extract and create two data sets: pro-drops and subjects
  Each subject or pro-drop has a verb associated with it
For each verb, report # associations with pro-drop and explicit subject

*T* in e.g. (NP-SBJ (-NONE- *T*-1)) means the subject is explicit in the sentence but preceded the verb.
