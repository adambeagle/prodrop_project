GENERAL GOAL
============
Extract and create two data sets: pro-drops and subjects
  Each subject or pro-drop has a verb associated with it
For each verb, report # associations with pro-drop and explicit subject

*T* in e.g. (NP-SBJ (-NONE- *T*-1)) means the subject is explicit in the sentence but preceded the verb.

CURRENT GOAL
============
Find all (-NONE- *) nodes that are children of NP-SBJ or a variant.
For each pro-drop node, find the associated verb.
	For now, assume associated verb has some variant of an IV tag.
	Ignore (and report?) otherwise.

NOTES
=====
Ignore all tag modifiers (-#, =, +, etc.)
Ignore - in front of words (strip?)

Associated verbs' tags are variants of IV

CONJ is a link to previous sentence?
