GENERAL GOAL
============
Extract and create two data sets: pro-drops and subjects
  Each subject or pro-drop has a verb associated with it
For each verb, report # associations with pro-drop and explicit subject

CURRENT GOAL
============
Find all (-NONE- *) nodes that are children of NP-SBJ or a variant.
For each pro-drop node, find the associated verb.
	For now, assume associated verb has some variant of an IV tag.
	Ignore (and report?) otherwise.

NOTES
=====
Ignore all tag modifiers (-#, =, +, etc.)
Ignore - in front of words (strip?)

Associated verbs' tags are variants of IV

CONJ is a link to previous sentence?

"Main verb" variations:
	(NOUN.VN+NSUFF_FEM_SG+CASE_DEF_GEN -مُشارَكَةِ)
	(PV+PVSUFF_SUBJ:3MS -أَوْضَحَ)
	(DET+NOUN.VN+CASE_DEF_ACC الدِفاعَ)


QUESTIONS
=========

Potential verbs to consider associated with a pro-drop:

TAG		OCCURENCES	MEANING
==============================================================
PV		4810		Perfect verb		
IV		4726		Imperfect verb
ADJ.VN		641		Verbal adjective
NOUN.VN		407		Verbal noun
CV   		99		Command verb
DET+ADJ.VN	70		Determiner + verbal adjective
PSEUDO-VERB	19
DIALECT		13
VERB		10
DET+NOUN.VN     10		Determiner + verbal noun	

Counting all these gets associated verb from 10,805 of 11,383 total pro-drops (95%).



What should be done in this situation?
Does the trace point to the NP-SBJ in the nested S tag?

(S (VP (PV_PASS+PVSUFF_SUBJ:3MS {ُعْتُبِرَ)
       (NP-SBJ (-NONE- *T*-1))
       (S (NP-SBJ (-NONE- *-1))
